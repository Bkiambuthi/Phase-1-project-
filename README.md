## conclusion and Recommedation

1. Investing in movies with a combination of Action, Adventure, science Fiction and Thriller will generate the highest average sales worldwide
2. Revenue on the movies increases with increase in the number of votes. Finding a way to encourage people to vote in turn will lead to more sales.
3. Further analysis is required to establish the reason for the decline in the revenue from 2010 onwards.
